# Image-reconstruction-and-denoising-images-with-convolution-autoencoders
simple convolution autoencoder implementation for image reconstruction and image denoising, performed on cats and dogs dataset, implemented by tensorflow 2
libraries used:- tensorflow2, numpy, pillow, os

My models's accuracy is not so good because I have trained only 5000 images with only 10 and 20 epochs because lack of computational power, 
but if model is trained on more images with more epochs it can achieve accuracy
